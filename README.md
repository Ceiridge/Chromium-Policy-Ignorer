# Chromium Policy Ignorer
Using this tool to *jailbreak* your Chromium browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.) is possible, but should only be done with allowance by your organisation.

Ignore Chromium's policy registry keys by hooking into `RegQueryInfoKeyW` (WINAPI function), so that it returns zero results when querying the policy keys.
